            Before this special day ends, I have a little message for you. 
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Thank you for being so patient and understanding, especially when I know I haven’t been at my best. This month has been really rough for both of us, and I know it hasn’t been easy. But despite everything, you’ve stayed strong and kept reliable and also someone that I can count on. You always know how to handle things, even when I’m all over the place, and that means so much to me.
        <p class="content">
            I can see how much effort you put into making sure I feel supported, even when you’re dealing with your own struggles. It’s not something I take for granted, and I really appreciate everything you’ve done. You’ve shown me how much you care, not just through words, but through your actions, and that’s what makes you so special.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            I don’t say this often enough, but I’m so lucky to have you. Thank you for being my constant, even when things get rough. I couldn’t have gotten through this without you, and I’m so grateful to have you by my side. 
        </p>
        <p class="content">
            Je t’aime tellement, mon amour.

        </p>
